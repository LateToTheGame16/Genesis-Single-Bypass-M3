# Sega Genesis Single Bypass Model 3
![top_screenshot](1bp-m3-top.png)
This is a redesign of the fantastic 3bp from dbElectronics and Tian Feng. The goal of this project was to minimize wires to only do the audio bypass. 

# Installation Instructions

Currently I suggest using the Audio installation instructions from the mega amp 2.0

# Not Confirmed Working
The schematic uses the same values as https://github.com/tianfeng33/triple-bypass-Version-2. 
The mechanicals changed to ease installation. The final boards are UNTESTED. Use at your own risk.
# Design Files
The designs are done with Kicad 6.0. The designs were done from scratch and are native to Kicad. 
# Change Log from V2
 - Schematics and Layout redrawn from scratch in Kicad.
# Model 3 Audio Only
 This is a minimalist board that restores audio levels and 32X audio to a Sega Genesis Model 3. 
  - Only three wires need to be soldered. Video signals are not touched.
  - UNTESTED USE AT OWN RISK
